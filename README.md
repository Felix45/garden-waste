# SKIP HIRE PROJECT

> A complete redesign of the ‚ÄúChoose Your Skip Size‚Äù page from the Garden Waste booking flow (found at https://wewantwaste.co.uk), built with React and Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern, and responsive experience.



## Built With

- React
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite

## Approaches & Design

### Clean, Reusable Components**:
I broke down the UI into purposeful, reusable React components (`SkipCard`, `SkipList`) improved maintainability and readability.

- `SkipCard` for display logic and styling  
- `SkipList` to map through provided data

### **Responsive Design**:  
I Leveraged Tailwind‚Äôs utility classes for quick iteration and responsive styling. Custom theme options kept the design consistent.

### **Data Handling & API Integration**
I Abstracted API calls into `redux store`, separating concerns and centralizing fetch logic. Skip data is dynamically fetched and handled with `useEffect` and `useState`.

- Used Tailwind CSS to ensure fluid layouts across mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints  
- Card grid adjusts columns and spacing responsively

- **Improved UI/UX**:  
- Modern card design with shadows, rounded corners, and clear CTA  
- Price and size details emphasized  
- Interactive hover/focus states boost accessibility
